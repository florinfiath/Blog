    "title":"Billionaire Don Hankey Spends $20.8 Million on Malibu’s Carbon Beach",
    "content":"<p>Low-profile business magnate Don Hankey has added to his already healthy stable of Malibu homes by expanding to Carbon Beach, the deluxe strip of sand sometimes referred to locally as “Billionaire’s Beach” because nearly all the residents there are members of the three comma club. A company linked to Hankey’s longtime wife has plunked down about $20.8 million for a large but decidedly oddball estate set immediately next door to a property owned by Larry Ellison, the Oracle kingpin and Carbon Beach’s de facto ruler.While he’s not exactly a household name, Hankey is indeed a three comma card carrier. Forbes says he packs a $3.2 billion pocketbook punch, a vast fortune primarily made in an unglamorous manner, by providing scores of subprime auto loans to credit-challenged clients. In recent years, however, Hankey and his slew of companies have expanded into the lucrative worlds of insurance, and real estate. That’s how the 77-year-old L.A. native wound up as the biggest creditor on “The One,” a Bel Air mega-mansion built by Nile Niami. Once marketed at $500 million, “The One” has since faced deep price cuts and foreclosure proceedings, the latter initiated by Hankey’s entities.As for the Carbon Beach estate, it’s not quite what you might expect of a $20 million Malibu mansion. Actually, it doesn’t look like a house at all. From Pacific Coast Highway, the place appears to be a rather unattractive commercial building, perhaps even a mini strip mall, with its three vacant side-by-side storefronts. But behind that façade lurk multiple other structures — three guest apartments, plus a midcentury main house and a separate pool house. There are also two swimming pools, each with their own in-ground spa.</p>",

    "title":"The Dry’ Is a Mystery Full of Small-Town Secrets, Suspicions",
    "content":"<p>Robert Connolly’s new film, The Dry, is a mystery at heart: An investigation into a small-town murder-suicide that inevitably kicks up the dust of other peoples’ secrets and picks the scabs on barely-healed wounds. Yet for all its depiction of police procedure and the ins and outs of investigation, it’s this other stuff — much of it backstory — that radiates from the film’s center. The circumstances of the crime, specifically the secrets of the man who ostensibly committed it, bleed into matters of the heart, and of memory. And of a sense of guilt that far surpasses this crime in itself. Yet the resolution of that crime — the actual, substantive answer to the whodunit — is almost secondary. Petty, really. Whereas what cannot be resolved by such tragedies looms — nearly suffocates.The movie, based on the 2016 bestseller by Jane Harper, stars Eric Bana as Aaron Falk, a federal police officer called back to his hometown of Kiewarra, in Australia’s Western Victoria, by a stark, accusatory letter. “Luke lied. You lied. Be at the funeral.” Luke: Aaron’s childhood friend, now dead, apparently by his own hand. So are his wife and oldest child. Only an infant remains. Well — and that lie, that known unknown that drives Aaron back home and leaves the facade of his adult successes as cracked and parched as the water-sapped terrain of Kiewarra.</p>",

    "title":"Sen. Ron Johnson Doesn’t Care If Your Wages Don’t Cover Childcare. ‘The Marketplace’ Has Spoken",
    "content":"<p>Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), who collects a $174,000 salary, thinks that there is a “downside” to paying workers a living wage enough to cover expenses such as childcare. Johnson made his remarks while appearing on WKOW-TV to defend his support of a bill in the Wisconsin state legislature that would end the $300 per week federal unemployment subsidy in the state — a bill the Democratic governor has said he will likely veto.</p>",
